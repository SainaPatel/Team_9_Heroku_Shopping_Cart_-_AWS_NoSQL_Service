-This week we finalized to develop an online bookstore application using Heroku Platform and using CouchDB as a backend using the S3 bucket service from Amazon Web service.

-We researched on the Heroku cloud Platform for developing the frontend using node.js.
-Heroku is a cloud platform based on a managed container system, with integrated data services and a powerful ecosystem, for deploying and running modern apps. 
-Heroku provides three types of platforms as below:

1.Heroku Runtime
Heroku runs your apps inside dynos — smart containers on a reliable, fully managed runtime environment. 

2.Heroku Developer Experience (DX)

The Heroku Developer Experience is an app-centric approach to software delivery so developers can focus on creating and continuously delivering applications, without being distracted by servers or infrastructure. 

3.Data Services and Ecosystem

Heroku Elements let developers extend their apps with Add-ons, customize their application stack with Buildpacks and jumpstart their projects with Buttons. 

-We created and deployed a sample node.js application on Heroku to learn about the flow of data and functioning mechanism.

- Developed a sample basic user interface using node.js
